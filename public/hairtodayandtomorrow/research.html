                <p>This meta-analysis looked at the risk of scalp metastases in breast cancer when scalp cooling was used. An American meta-analysis shows there was no difference in the incidents of scalp metastases between scalp cooled and non-scalp cooled patients. 0.6% of the scalp cooled and 0.4% of the non-scalp cooled patients showed metastases. There was no statistical difference between the groups. Scalp metastasis appears rare in breast cancer and the frequency is not affected by scalp cooling.</p>

                <h1>Penguin Cold Caps Efficacy</h1>
                <p>Penguin cold caps was established in 1997 and claim “average hair retention >80% even with strong regimes”. This claim comes from recent studies plus monitoring success in terms of feedback and cap hire duration (e.g. 1 month hire presumed a treatment failure).  The recommended duration of post chemotherapy infusion cold capping (often 4 hours plus) is based on a research study (Komen 2018) which showed that longer cooling leads to reduced hair loss and also clinical experience /feedback from chemotherapy nurses.</p>
                <p>Penguin is widely used internationally, and professional cappers are often used in the USA. The founders of The Rapunzel Project in the USA have observed that Penguin is often more successful with challenging chemotherapy such as anthracyclines.</p>
                <p>Published research is limited but suggests that Penguin cold caps are effective in reducing Chemotherapy Induced Alopecia CIA.</p>

                <p class="underline">Rezayee et el published in Current Problems in Cancer 2021</p>
                <p>A pilot study of care-giver training to maximise Penguin manual cold capping efficacy. They also developed a questionnaire to help with decision making for whether to cold cap or not and looked at the subjective experience of cold capping.</p>
                <p>The study was a small pilot involving 10 women who were receiving a range of chemotherapies.  Paclitaxel/ Carboplatin 5/10, AC-T 3/10, TC Docetaxel/cyclophosphamide 1/10, Paclitaxel 1/10. 80% of the women were successful in keeping more than 50% of hair based on Dean’s alopecia scale 30 days post treatment. 2/10 discontinued cold capping prematurely. The study found that training cold capping assistants was helpful and that many people would find the process complicated without assistance.</p>

                <p>A registry of Penguin cold cap success rates with a range of chemotherapies. This study involving 103 patients and outcomes included both patient and doctor CIA ratings.</p>
                <p>Overall, 61% of patients successfully prevented CIA; impact was regimen specific: TCH 100%, TC × 4 84%, TC × 5-6 50%, P/AC 43%, AC/P 20%. The most success was for shorter taxane based chemotherapy. In combination anthracycline chemotherapy, there was more success when the taxane was given before the anthracycline.</p>

Cooling with both Paxman and the cold cap reduced alopecia by 78% on Docetaxel mono therapy. The cold cap and Paxman were equally effective and 45 minutes after infusion cooling was adequate. There seemed to be no difference between the Paxman system and the manual cold cap in terms of efficacy and tolerability.</p>

                <h1>Paxman Scalp Cooling Machine Research</h1>
                <p>Paxman scalp cooling machines were first invented in 1997 and are now widely used around the world. The Paxman website includes links to many research trials.</p>
                <p>The website also has a very useful Decision Making Guide with efficacy percentages for keeping 50% or more of hair based largely on a large international registry’s data.  The international registry CHILL is an ongoing study of hair loss rates and the effects of cold capping with Paxman.</p>

                <p>Paxman’s efficacy seems to be largely dependent on chemotherapy type, but with wide individual variation. For example, taxane monotherapy can have efficacy from 70-95%, TC around 50%, AC-T 34% (T-AC said to be more successful). There also seems to be differing efficacy between different ethnicity’s hair types.</p>
                <p>Paxman is currently working on several research projects e.g. looking at improving success for combination chemotherapies.</p>

                <p>Scalp cooling for female Japanese breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy had a 54% success rate with Taxane and/or Anthracycline based chemotherapy. 69% received Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide and 28% AC or EC followed by an Taxane. Scalp cooling was free for the first cycle after which there was a large charge and many people withdrew and were used as the control group.  The rate of full hair loss after TC was 55% compared with 19% for AC followed by a Taxane.</p>

                <p>A randomised control trial using the Paxman machine and different chemotherapies, different sites in the USA and 182 women with breast cancer. They found there was a difference in success depending on hospital site. This was thought to possibly be related to proper fitting of the cap. They found that 59% of women had successful hair retention on Taxane chemotherapy and 16% on Anthracycline chemotherapy.  The exact type of chemotherapy was not defined in the published article. Success was defined as <50% hair loss and not requiring a wig.</p>
                <p>According to the Paxman website, an update from the authors of the Nangia 2017 scalp trial was that there was an increase in difference between the cooling and non-cooling group. Taxane’s had a rate of 63% and Anthracycline’s 24.1%. (TC chemo was about 50%).</p>

                <p>Japanese study showed a minimum of 27% success with Anthracycline and Taxane based therapy using the Paxman scalp cooling system.  More than 60% of patients were treated with TC regime Docetaxel/Cyclophosphamide and the remaining patients received AC. There was a difference between whether both assessors graded the alopecia or independently. It was 26% if both of the assessors determined alopecia and 60% when either clinical assessor judged independently.  </p>
                <p>85% of patients experienced an increase in hair volume more than 50% within 12 weeks after chemotherapy and 50% of the control group. 25% of those who had recovered from alopecia after 12 weeks in the scalp cooling group and only 8% in the control group. It was felt that scalp cooling resulted in a faster recovery of hair volume after chemotherapy even in patients for whom scalp cooling had failed to prevent chemotherapy induced alopecia. The Japanese head shape being different and the requirement to have two assessors judge the alopecia the same, may have led to lower results in this study. Paxman reports that the caps do not fit Japanese head shapes well.</p>

                <h3>Prevention of persistent alopecia pCIA research</h3>

                <p class="underline">Martin et al published in Breast Cancer Research in Treatment 2018</p>
                <p>Assessed the effect of scalp cooling on persistent alopecia following Docetaxel for breast cancer. Without scalp-cooling, Grade 2 alopecia (complete baldness requiring a wig) was seen in 10% of 358 patients on higher dose Docetaxel (400 CD and above) at 18 months follow-up. Grade 1 alopecia (less severe, not requiring a wig) was seen in 33-52% on Docetaxel. Noted that in most cases chemotherapy induced alopecia starts two weeks after the initial chemotherapy and starts to reverse 3-4 months after the termination of the final treatment. When scalp cooling with an Elasto-gel cap was used, there was no instances of Grade 2 persistent alopecia seen with high dose Docetaxel in 116 patients. It therefore seemed that scalp cooling is effective in preventing persistent alopecia from Docetaxel.</p>
